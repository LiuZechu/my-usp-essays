**Module Synopsis**:

In this team-taught course, we consider some of the key issues shaping global politics in the modern world and examine how political, strategic, technological and economic aspects of international relations interact with, and reinforce, one another in creating the current global order. Scholars from various fields of expertise will cover a range of current and historical issues, which are planned to include: an introduction to war and the beginning of international relations; the role of economics and trade; diplomacy, international law and the United Nations; the rise of regional powers in a globalised world; China, the new global player; climate change and the new Arctic frontier; dealing with crises â€“ Eurozone and refugees; Brexit and the future of the EU; negotiating peace in the Middle East; and future prospects for peace and prosperity.
