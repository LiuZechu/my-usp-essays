**Module Synopsis**:

ULS2208: Biodiversity and Natural History in Singapore is an USP Inquiry Tier module that investigates nature with close, inquiry-driven observations, and explores the self in relation to the natural world through an awareness of one’s sensory experience and their associated perceptions and concepts. With a strong fieldwork component and focus on experiential learning, the ultimate goal of this module is to develop students into capable and passionate naturalists with a sense of wonder and curiosity for the natural world – even after they graduate from the module and university. Location-wise, Singapore offers a unique situation for studying natural history: it is situated within a megadiverse biodiversity-hotspot, and has drastically-reduced natural areas, yet remaining surprisingly species-rich. Combined with her colonial legacy, infrastructural capabilities and cultural biases, Singapore offers a rich but oft-neglected natural heritage for students to examine and explore.
