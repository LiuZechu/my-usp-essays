# Language, Cognition and Culture (UHB2207)

## Essay Questions
- `effects_of_linguistic_classifiers_on_object_concepts.pdf`: Write about how one of the topics below is germane to arguments concerning linguistic relativity — language/culture/cognition. Specifically, the task is to “cover the controversy” — explain it, the assumptions involved, and the implications of what is at stake conceptually in relation to the idea of linguistic relativity. Topic chosen: Linguistic Classifiers and Object Concepts.
- `codeswitching_project.pdf`: Examine your own (and/or classmates’) codeswitching practices, and make an argument about how codeswitching serves social or cognitive purposes (or both). Specify what those purposes are and show the evidence. Evince earlier work/readings on relativity here, if applicable, and advance a novel argument.
- `gesture_group_project.pdf`: Study video data you collect on yourselves in bilingual performance and make an argument about the connection between your gesture practices and your multilingualism. Specify what that connection is, evince earlier work/readings on relativity/bilingualism, and refer to evidence from your video data.

**Module Synopsis**:

Does the language you speak affect how you think, or how you feel, or your sense of who you are? This module explores the deep interconnections between language, cognition and culture. It begins by introducing the nature of language, dialects, and registers, and assesses what sort of information is encoded in language itself-- and what is lost when a language disappears. We then turn to issues surrounding bilingualism and biculturalism, and ask to what extent we conflate the logics of our multiple languages, or whether we keep them distinct. We explore whether we think or feel differently when speaking different languages, and in what ways that might be manifested. For data, we analyze our own everyday language practices — including code-switching, metaphor and gesture — to help us determine in more concrete terms how and in what ways language is connected to thought on the one hand and culture on the other.
