# Globalising Asian-Pacific Identities (USE2209)

## Essay Questions
- `oral_history_assignment.pdf`: For this assignment, you interview a person who is at least 15 years older than you. We are looking for personal experiences that can add to our module’s awareness of events before you. Your questions will identify, then probe, the interviewee’s memories of engaging diasporic African expression (if the person normally identifies as Asian) or of Asian-Pacific identity (if the person normally identifies as African or as diasporic African). Tell us what you asked, then reveal how the person responded and what you learned about fixities and fluidities, roots or routes, and the past.
- `visual_project_assignment.pdf`: In class, we have talked about surfaces and what lies beneath them. We are learning about phenotypes and about changeable appearances: for example, make-up that is easy to wash away or clothing styles. Our interest spans what is fixed, what is fluid, and much that lies in between. To take the next step, you will examine a visual representation of an Asian-Pacific figure. Report your initial impression. Before or after doing so, report the re-perceiving experiences that you have achieved by probing the visual with help from issues that we have raised in class, and readings that we have discussed, by the time this project is due.
- `you_choose_assignment.pdf`: Explain your learning in *Globalising Asian-Pacific Identities* to an interviewer for an internship, NOC (NUS Overseas College), study abroad, or an entry-level job. Explain your learning with a firm sense that your interviewer is a practical person who hopes to allot resources to best effect. If you grasp your purpose as thinking through your learning, but also as sharing with someone else whose education has gone in other directions, you start well.

**Module Synopsis**:

Growing up with Facebook, cinema, YouTube, and more, you may have felt that you had the globe at your fingertips. Yet have you interrogated effects of this feeling on your ability to act as an independent, adaptable thinker and doer? Is it possible that media have taught you to act as a spectator, only, rather than as a curious, possibly courageous, world citizen when you study abroad, travel, consider migrant issues, or seek employment? This module explores integrity, openness and maybe expressivity, through one strand of identity, Asian-Pacificness. However, certain lessons may transfer to strands such as gender/sex, age, faith, and able-ism. A thought-provocation is sociologist Paul Gilroy’s insight that in a diasporic world, roots may matter less than commerce-impelled routes of transmission.
