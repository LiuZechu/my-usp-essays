# Quantum Computation (UIT2205)

## Essay and Assignment Questions
- `first_essay.pdf`: Discuss: “Since the apparition of life on Earth, the only source of knowledge has
essentially been the brain of *Homo sapiens*, a brain that has brought forth Sience and Technology. 
Given the slow pace of biological evolution, technological evolution seems extremely rapid, so rapid that
one may wonder: Will information technology bring a new source of knowledge? If yes, should we fear it 
or welcome it?” Max. 8 pages.
- `final_essay.pdf`: Discuss: “The prediction of celestial events was a powerful motivation to design early
automata. Later, after Newton's law of gravitation and the development of more complex automata, the idea
of a clockwork universe gained momentum. Today, with the advancement of computers and progresses towards
quantum computers, one may wonder: Is the universe a quantum computer?” Max. 8 pages.
- `quantum_phase_estimation_presentation.pdf`: Each group will choose a quantum algorithm and read related peer-reviewed articles, before presenting to the rest of the class.

**Module Synopsis**:

Is teleportation really about travelling instantaneously from one point in space to another? Will our
faint online privacy remain with the advent of quantum computers? Will quantum computation help
us reveal the last mysteries of our universe? What tasks will quantum computers help us do better?
While very much a technology of the future, quantum computers promise new possibilities that will
greatly exceed those of our current technology. The module examines some of these possibilities
and explores how our notion of information has evolved. Furthermore, the module provides not
only an introduction to the field of quantum computation but also an introduction to the realm of
quantum theory. Students will acquire the basic principles that underlie computer science and
quantum physics and gain insights into some of the fascinating revolutions that are currently taking
place. The module will draw upon the limitations of classical computation and the challenges it has
been subjected to. Topics covered will engage students to analyse critically some of the bizarre
implications of the quantum world and to make sense of notions that are sometimes perceived as
incomprehensible.
