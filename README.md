# A Selection of My USP Essays

The [University Scholars Programme (USP)](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/) is a four-year academic programme in the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). The programme offers a diverse range of [interdisciplinary modules](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/curriculum/usp-modules/) that focus on writing and critifical thinking skills, intellectual curiosity, reflective thinking and asking questions.

As my USP journey is drawing to a close in a year's time, I wanted to consolidate the works I did, no matter whether they're good or bad, that documented my growth as a USP student. This repository contains a selection of the essays that I have written in my past three years in USP, involving the following modules (in **chronological order**):
- [Conditions of Happiness](https://github.com/LiuZechu/my-usp-essays/tree/main/conditions-of-happiness) by Dr Bart Van Wassenhove — Fall 2018
- [Globalising Asian-Pacific Identities](https://github.com/LiuZechu/my-usp-essays/tree/main/globalising-asian-pacific-identities) by A/P Barbara Ryan — Spring 2019
- [Language, Cognition and Culture](https://github.com/LiuZechu/my-usp-essays/tree/main/language-cognition-and-culture) by A/P Peter Vail — Fall 2019
- [Quantifying Nuclear Risks](https://github.com/LiuZechu/my-usp-essays/tree/main/quantifying-nuclear-risks) by Dr Philippe Raynal — Fall 2019
- [Quantum Computation](https://github.com/LiuZechu/my-usp-essays/tree/main/quantum-computation) by Dr Philippe Raynal — Spring 2020
- [Biodiversity and Natural History in Singapore](https://github.com/LiuZechu/my-usp-essays/tree/main/biodiversity-and-natural-history-in-singapore) by Dr Ang Yuchen — Spring 2021

## Conditions of Happiness

**Module Synopsis**: 

In this course, we will investigate a fundamental human question: what is happiness, and what do we need to attain it? Is happiness primarily about being satisfied with our lives or does it consist in fulfilling our emotional aspirations or in having a positive balance of pleasure over pain? Is happiness an all-encompassing goal, or can it conflict with other considerations such as meaning, morality, or authenticity? If so, how do we address such conflicts? To reflect on this set of questions about happiness and well-being, we will investigate the arguments of philosophers, psychologists, and cultural critics. The goal of our inquiry is not so much to arrive at a fixed answers but to critically reflect on the concept of happiness from different angles. In addition to investigating the topic of happiness, this course will serve as an introduction to the craft of writing and critical thinking. We will begin by analysing the basic elements of academic writing and discuss strategies to help you construct a well-reasoned argument, respond to other writers’ claims, and anticipate objections. Subsequently, we will discuss the structural elements of an effective research paper, with particular attention to strategies for revising your first draft. After the mid-semester break, we will discuss how to generate a significant research question and how to identify, evaluate, and use sources to support your own argument.

## Globalising Asian-Pacific Identities

**Module Synopsis**:

Growing up with Facebook, cinema, YouTube, and more, you may have felt that you had the globe at your fingertips. Yet have you interrogated effects of this feeling on your ability to act as an independent, adaptable thinker and doer? Is it possible that media have taught you to act as a spectator, only, rather than as a curious, possibly courageous, world citizen when you study abroad, travel, consider migrant issues, or seek employment? This module explores integrity, openness and maybe expressivity, through one strand of identity, Asian-Pacificness. However, certain lessons may transfer to strands such as gender/sex, age, faith, and able-ism. A thought-provocation is sociologist Paul Gilroy’s insight that in a diasporic world, roots may matter less than commerce-impelled routes of transmission.

## Language, Cognition and Culture
**Link to Module Website**: [https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/curriculum/usp-modules/language-cognition-and-culture/](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/curriculum/usp-modules/language-cognition-and-culture/)

**Module Synopsis**:

Does the language you speak affect how you think, or how you feel, or your sense of who you are? This module explores the deep interconnections between language, cognition and culture. It begins by introducing the nature of language, dialects, and registers, and assesses what sort of information is encoded in language itself-- and what is lost when a language disappears. We then turn to issues surrounding bilingualism and biculturalism, and ask to what extent we conflate the logics of our multiple languages, or whether we keep them distinct. We explore whether we think or feel differently when speaking different languages, and in what ways that might be manifested. For data, we analyze our own everyday language practices — including code-switching, metaphor and gesture — to help us determine in more concrete terms how and in what ways language is connected to thought on the one hand and culture on the other. 

## Quantifying Nuclear Risks
**Link to Module Website**: [https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/curriculum/usp-modules/quantitative-reasoning-foundation-quantifying-nuclear-risks/](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/curriculum/usp-modules/quantitative-reasoning-foundation-quantifying-nuclear-risks/)

**Module Synopsis**:

What is the lowest dose of radiation that can lead to cancer? Is it safe to live near a nuclear power plant? Can your home make you sick because of the presence of a natural radioactive gas called Radon? The module examines nuclear risks from a quantitative standpoint. After introducing the basics of nuclear power, we will learn the facts about nuclear risks and how they can be measured. The goal of the module is to provide students with the quantitative methods and the tools they need to be critically thinking citizens.

## Quantum Computation
**Link to Module Website**: [https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/curriculum/usp-modules/quantum-computation/](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/curriculum/usp-modules/quantum-computation/)

**Module Synopsis**:

While very much a technology of the future, quantum computers promise new possibilities that will greatly exceed those of our current technology. The module examines some of these possibilities and explores how our notion of information has evolved. Furthermore, the module provides not only an introduction to the field of quantum computing but also an introduction to the realm of quantum theory.

## Biodiversity and Natural History in Singapore
**Link to Module Website**: [https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/curriculum/module-timetable/biodiversity-and-natural-history-in-singapore/](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/curriculum/module-timetable/biodiversity-and-natural-history-in-singapore/)

**Module Synopsis**:

This module investigates nature with close, inquiry-driven observations, and explores the self in relation to the natural world through an awareness of one’s sensory experience and their associated perceptions and concepts. With a strong fieldwork component and focus on experiential learning, the ultimate goal of this module is to develop students into capable and passionate naturalists with a sense of wonder and curiosity for the natural world – even after they graduate from the module and university. Location-wise, Singapore offers a unique situation for studying natural history: it is situated within a megadiverse biodiversity-hotspot, and has drastically-reduced natural areas, yet remaining surprisingly species-rich. Combined with her colonial legacy, infrastructural capabilities and cultural biases, Singapore offers a rich but oft-neglected natural heritage for students to examine and explore.
