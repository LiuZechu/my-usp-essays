# A Selection of My USP Essays

The [University Scholars Programme (USP)](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/) is a four-year academic programme in the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). The programme offers a diverse range of [interdisciplinary modules]
(https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/curriculum/usp-modules/)that focus on writing and critifical thinking skills, intellectual curiosity, reflective thinking and asking questions.
