# Quantifying Nuclear Risks (UQF2101G)

## Essay Questions
- `should_governments_pursue_nuclear_power.pdf`: Write an essay to answer the question: “Are you a proponent or an opponent of nuclear power?”. The goal of this essay is to provide a scientific answer to
this question. Your essay will take the form of a cost-benefit analysis comparing all existing sources of 
energy available to produce electricity. You will not single out nuclear power but instead all sources of
energy will be treated on an equal footing until you can reach a conclusion. You will use descriptive
statistics, estimates, statistical tests, and models to analyse data related to electricity production
from nuclear fuel, fossil fuels (coal, gas, and oil), and renewable energy (solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and biomass). You will carefully discuss the assumptions, the limitations, their corresponding
solutions, and also the strengths of your arguments. Max. 8 pages.

**Module Synopsis**:

What is the lowest dose of radiation that can lead to cancer? Is it safe to live near a nuclear power plant? Can your home make you sick because of the presence of a natural radioactive gas called Radon?
Can a nuclear plant explode like a nuclear bomb? 
The module examines nuclear risks from a quantitative standpoint. After introducing the basics of nuclear power, we will learn the facts about nuclear risks and how they can be measured. The goal of the module is to provide students with the quantitative methods and the tools they need to be critically thinking citizens.
